However, the other many columns of genres and tags cannot be well graphed as these are set as \"on-or-off\". This is difficult to represent graphically. One instance that could be changing the type to frequency of the tag thus a better gradient occurs across one \"tag\" column. Lastly, the difference in years also shows a difference in clustering as some movies did not contain a year thus it was set to 0. \n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Based on the data setup, it is difficult to understand the results. Genres and tags are split into multiple columns and contain binary data for each instance. With the variety of columns, plotting is difficult to understand. In terms of algorithms, Kmeans is set to four clusters based on DBScan's output of 3 clusters. All in all, altering the input data will assist with better understandable output.\n",
